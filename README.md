# ANN
solving the dataset using ANN techinque
ANN(...) this files has 3 differnet solution for Churn_Modelling dataset 
ANN(2) is a file with complete code(solution) for Churn_Modelling dataset which include hyperpaprmeter tuning where as ANN(K) has has only hyperpaprmeter tuning which is different from ANN(K)
all this models got accuracy more that 83-85%
